# Physical-Health-Benefits-of-Having-Sex

From the moment most of us become sexually active – be it through exploring your body during puberty, or having intercourse for the first time – a not-so-secret little fact becomes known: having sex is great. What you might not know is that in addition to feeling great, sex is good for your health.

While we likely aren’t introduced to the various physical and mental benefits of sex at the same time as the act itself, that doesn’t mean we aren’t taking advantage of them. 

As it turns out, sexual activity, whether it be masturbation or intercourse, is good for you. It’s certainly an idea that many of us innately know, but decades of research also back it up. 

The pros of sex cover multiple aspects of our lives, including:

1) Physical
2) Mental
3) Emotional
4) Psychological
5) Social

And even sexual – that’s right, having sex leads to more sex via an increase in libido and comfort level. Regular sexual activity should be considered an essential part of overall well-being rather than a taboo or embarrassing subject. There are simply too many upsides not to embrace the conversation. Here are just some of the physical and mental benefits to sex.

## Physical Health Benefits of Having Sex

Sexual intercourse requires muscles, movement, blood flow, and ultimately – relaxation. Another activity that features all of the above is light exercise. While sex shouldn’t be relied upon solely in the pursuit of an active lifestyle, it can help accomplish many of the same benefits as resistance training or cardiovascular exercise. 

Naturally, intercourse can burn calories – as many as five per minute in fact. That’s about five times as many as sitting alone on the couch. It also helps to strengthen your muscles, and increases your libido. Simply put, having sex can result in even more sex – talk about having your cake and eating it too.

The physical health benefits of sex are more than simply skin, or even muscle-deep however. Sex can lower your blood pressure, which can have positive effects on your risk for heart disease, stroke, and hypertension. While we’re on the subject, lowering your blood pressure can also help cure ED. In addition, frequent sex among adults in healthy relationships – in this case, defined by once or twice over a weeklong period – manifested in raised levels of immunoglobulin A, or igA. This helpful antibody fights against illnesses and boosts your immune system.

Another boost to your immune system is better sleep – and guess what helps contribute to that? Oxytocin and endorphins released after achieving orgasm are happy little byproducts that make for more restful nights. 

Men in particular can find unique health benefits of sex in the form of reduced risk of prostate cancer. A recent studious review found this to be the case among men who practice frequent intercourse with their partners. However, going at it solo was also found to be beneficial, as men who ejaculate between four and seven times per week lowered that probability of being diagnosed with prostate cancer before the age of 70 by 36%.

Finally, sex can help you look younger – by as many as seven to twelve years according to one study. It also helps clear up your complexion. Perhaps that “after glow” term didn’t just get its name from nothing.

Of course, maybe the best overall benefit backed up by medical studies involving adults with active sex lives is the fact that having more intercourse is closely correlated with more active lifestyles. The result is a self-perpetuating cycle that results in happier and healthy human beings.
